description: >
  Server-computed scannability assessment returned on every QR code generation response.
  A `score` of 100 means no issues detected. Scores below 70 indicate the code may
  fail to scan reliably in poor lighting or at small print sizes.

    description: >
      Scannability score from 0 (likely unscannable) to 100 (optimal).
      Computed from contrast ratio, quiet zone adequacy, and logo coverage.

            Machine-readable warning code. Possible values:
            `LOW_CONTRAST` — foreground/background contrast ratio is below 3:1;
            `QUIET_ZONE_VIOLATION` — the quiet zone around the QR code is too small;
            `LOGO_TOO_LARGE` — logo was scaled down to fit within the 20% area limit.

          enum:
            - LOW_CONTRAST
            - QUIET_ZONE_VIOLATION

          example: 'Contrast ratio between foreground (#6d6d6d) and background (#FFFFFF) is 2.8:1, below the recommended minimum of 3:1. Scanning may fail in poor lighting.'

      - code: LOW_CONTRAST
        message: 'Contrast ratio is 2.8:1, below the recommended minimum of 3:1.'
