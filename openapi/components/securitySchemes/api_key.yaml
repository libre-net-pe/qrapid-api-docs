scheme: bearer
bearerFormat: APIKey
description: >
  A long-lived API key issued via the QRapid dashboard. Suitable for
  server-to-server integrations where using the Firebase SDK is impractical.

  Pass the key in the `Authorization` header:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer sk_live_<your-api-key>
  ```

  Keys are scoped to a single user account. Treat them as secrets — do not
  expose them in client-side code or public repositories. Rotate compromised
  keys immediately from the dashboard.
